# Youtube-Video-Tag-Prediction

### Overview

I have developed YouTube Video Tag Prediction Model using Keras Sequential API. The descriptions under the video is used as input data to predict tags as the output.I have used two datasets from [Trending YouTube Video Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new).
Due to limited hardware capacity, I have used two files of the countries - US (USvideos.csv) and Great Britain (GBvideos.csv) for building the model. However, I recommend using all the files from the above linked Kaggle dataset for better performance as it's a known fact that deep learning models perform extremely well on more data.

Note - I was unable to upload the datasets because every single file is more than 25MB. However, you can click on the link above to download the files.
